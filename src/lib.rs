//!
//! # Pop3 client
//!
//! This is a simple Pop3 client that implements all of the features according to [RFC 1939](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1939), written in Rust.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! You can create a new session using the `connect` function or the `connect_plain` function.
//!
//! `connect` expects a tls connector from the `async-native-tls` crate. In the future more tls options will be supported.
//!
//! If you already have a connected socket, you can also create a new session using the `new` function.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! extern crate async_pop;
//! extern crate async_native_tls;
//! extern crate mailparse;
//!
//! use async_native_tls::TlsConnector;
//! use mailparse::parse_mail;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     let tls = TlsConnector::new();
//!
//!     let mut client = async_pop::connect(("pop.gmail.com", 995), "pop.gmail.com", &tls, None).await.unwrap();
//!
//!     client.login("example@gmail.com", "password").await.unwrap();
//!
//!     let bytes = client.retr(1).await.unwrap();
//!
//!     let message = parse_mail(&bytes).unwrap();
//!
//!     let subject = message.headers.get_first_value("Subject").unwrap();
//!
//!     println!("{}", subject);
//!
//! }
//! ```

    /// Normally, each POP3 session starts with a USER/PASS exchange.  This results in a server/user-id specific password being sent in the clear on the network.  For intermittent use of POP3, this may not introduce a sizable risk.  However, many POP3 client implementations connect to the POP3 server on a regular basis -- to check for new mail.  Further the interval of session initiation may be on the order of five minutes.  Hence, the risk of password capture is greatly enhanced.

    ///
    /// A POP3 server which implements the APOP command will include a timestamp in its banner greeting.  The syntax of the timestamp corresponds to the `msg-id' in [RFC822], and MUST be different each time the POP3 server issues a banner greeting.  For example, on a UNIX implementation in which a separate UNIX process is used for each instance of a POP3 server, the syntax of the timestamp might be:
    ///
    /// `<process-ID.clock@hostname>`
    ///
    /// where `process-ID' is the decimal value of the process's PID, clock is the decimal value of the system clock, and hostname is the fully-qualified domain-name corresponding to the host where the POP3 server is running.
    ///
    /// The POP3 client makes note of this timestamp, and then issues the APOP command.  The `name` parameter has identical semantics to the `name` parameter of the USER command. The `digest` parameter is calculated by applying the MD5 algorithm [RFC1321] to a string consisting of the timestamp (including angle-brackets) followed by a shared

    ///

    ///
    /// If a common mechanism is needed, it can probably be found in the [sasl] module.
    ///
    /// The AUTH command indicates an authentication mechanism to the server.  If the server supports the requested authentication mechanism, it performs an authentication protocol exchange to authenticate and identify the user. Optionally, it also negotiates a protection mechanism for subsequent protocol interactions.  If the requested authentication mechanism is not supported, the server should reject the AUTH command by sending a negative response.
    ///
    /// The authentication protocol exchange consists of a series of server challenges and client answers that are specific to the authentication mechanism.  A server challenge, otherwise known as a ready response, is a line consisting of a "+" character followed by a single space and a BASE64 encoded string.  The client answer consists of a line containing a BASE64 encoded string.  If the client wishes to cancel an authentication exchange, it should issue a line with a single "*".  If the server receives such an answer, it must reject the AUTH command by sending a negative response.
    ///
    /// A protection mechanism provides integrity and privacy protection to the protocol session.  If a protection mechanism is negotiated, it is applied to all subsequent data sent over the connection.  The protection mechanism takes effect immediately following the CRLF that concludes the authentication exchange for the client, and the CRLF of the positive response for the server.  Once the protection mechanism is in effect, the stream of command and response octets is processed into buffers of ciphertext.  Each buffer is transferred over the connection as a stream of octets prepended with a four octet field in network byte order that represents the length of the following data. The maximum ciphertext buffer length is defined by the protection mechanism.
    ///
    /// The server is not required to support any particular authentication mechanism, nor are authentication mechanisms required to support any protection mechanisms.  If an AUTH command fails with a negative response, the session remains in the AUTHORIZATION state and client may try another authentication mechanism by issuing another AUTH command, or may attempt to authenticate by using the USER/PASS or APOP commands.  In other words, the client may request authentication types in decreasing order of preference, with the USER/PASS or APOP command as a last resort.
